# BAIR RL IPPO

This repository contains a simple Jupyter notebook showcasing the
Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) algorithm for
multi‑agent reinforcement learning. Use it as a starting point for
exploring policy gradient methods in multi‑agent settings.

## Contents

- `bair-rl-ippo.ipynb`: Notebook with IPPO implementation and example
  usage.

## Getting Started

1. Launch Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Open `bair-rl-ippo.ipynb`.
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the experiment.

Feel free to extend the notebook with your own environments or
enhancements to the algorithm.
